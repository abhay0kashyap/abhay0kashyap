# Hey 👋 I’m Abhay Kashyap

🎓 Final-year Computer Science Engineering student  
💻 Frontend & Product-focused Developer  
🚀 Building thoughtful, future-ready web experiences  

I’m interested in **technology that feels simple, useful, and human**.  
My focus is on building products that combine **clean design, solid logic, and real-world relevance**.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a final-year CSE student who enjoys turning ideas into usable products.  

I care deeply about **clarity, consistency, and user experience**, and I like working on projects that sit at the intersection of **technology, design, and future thinking**.  

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my frontend skills, improving how I structure applications, and learning how good products are actually built — not just how they look.  

My long-term goal is to grow into a developer who builds **impactful, well-thought-out software**, not just features.
